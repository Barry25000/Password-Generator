## My Notes

This was a very challenging project.
I was unsure how to start at first and spent hours trying to figure this out.
I went back and watched recorded Zoom classes, worked W3 schools JavaScript online tutorial.
I am very happy that I was able to get this to work correctly.

I added a pseudo code document.
I added comments in my source code.
I have uploaded the HTML and made live.
